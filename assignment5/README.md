## 3.Explanation
### Task 1:Child component
Child component, Square, is a functional component with required style. The Square component has local state:status, global state:count, and props that inherit from its parent:FourSquares. 
### Task 2:Parent component
The parent component is a functonal component as well which is consist of four child components. Additionally, there is a counter at the top. The parent component pass props, name in this case, to its children.

### Task 3:Clean and readable code
I tried to make the code clean, concise and readable.

### Extra points:Use Redux
I use react-reduc to manupilate global state, count in this case.
